<p>The Monty Hall problem is a brain-teaser that is loosely based on the TV show Let's Make A Deal and its original host Monty Hall. The standard theoretical game goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose you are on a game show, and you are given the choice of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the others are goats. You choose one of the doors!</li>
<li> Monty Hall, who knows where the car and goats are located, opens one of the other two doors that has a goat behind it.</li>
<li>Monty then asks if you would like to stay with your current choice or switch to the other door. </li>

</ul>

Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Play the game to find out!!!
